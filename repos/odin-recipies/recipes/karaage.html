    <h1>Karaage Recipe</h1>
    <p>Japanese-style fried chicken that is crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.</p>
    <p>Karaage originally meant deep fried meat or fish without any marinating. The cooking method of pre-marinating ingredients came from China in the early Edo period. At the time, Japanese people called China ‘tou’ (唐), but this kanji character can also read ‘kara‘, particularly when combined with other characters. Hence the word 唐揚げ became ‘karaage’  instead of ‘touage‘.</p>
